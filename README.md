# MERN: Book Search Engine

Most modern websites are driven by two things: data and user demands. The true cornerstone of web development today is giving the end user the ability to personalize data. Utilizing Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, I alot of the code to allow the end user to fetch and modify data, modified middleware so it works with GraphQL, and created an Apollo server to run alongside node.
